    <p>Hello class, my name is Alec Willits and I'm a web design and development major, with an emphasis in development. 
        I've selected this major because I find that solving problems using computer programs is fun and interesting. 
        It stretches my brain and requires me to learn extra skills and extra things to solve the problem. 
        At least while I'm still learning, it always seems like every problem requires me to learn something else which excites me. 
        My technical background includes having networking skills as well as help desk position type skills. 
        After I get my degree and get my job, it'll be the first time I am involved outside of school in a development type position. 
        Some of my strengths: I don't give up on a problem until it's solved. 
        I'm at the point where if I come across a problem that I don't know how to solve, I know enough to know where to go to find the answer. 
        Some of my weaknesses come from the current demands of my time. 
        I work full time, and my wife and I just had our first child just a few months ago. Currently, I am planning to graduate at the end of the semester.</p>

    <p>My wife Sara and I live in Idaho Falls. As I mentioned previously, my wife and I just had a new addition to our family. We had our first child, his name is Koda and he is a lovely addition to our family. 
        My hobbies include going to the gym with my wife, spending time with them at home by playing games and reading books. 
        I enjoy watching movies and TV shows and in the summer we usually spend our time outdoors by going on hikes and doing various activities around the yard. 
        I know we have Learning teams this semester but if anyone has any questions I'm available any day of the week after 5pm MST. 
        Feel free to reach out to me with an E-mail and I would gladly do what I can to help.</p>

    <p>Nice to meet you! - <a href="mailto:wil16077@byui.edu">wil16077@byui.edu</a></p>
